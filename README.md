Identification of Clinical Significance of genetic variants using LightGBM blended with Attention Mechanism.

### Overview

PathogenicityPredictor is a powerful tool designed to accurately identify clinical significance from genomic data, which is a major step towards personalized healthcare and early diagnosis. This intelligent machine learning system blends gradient boosting with an attention mechanism to analyze genetic mutations and predict different labels of clinical significance.

Built on data from ClinVar, a trusted database containing detailed information on large-scale genetic variants, our approach analyzes genetic data by learning the feature importance responsible for each mutation. The system is particularly effective at recognizing subtle, complex patterns that might otherwise go unnoticed in genomic data.

With an impressive accuracy of 93.75%, precision of 0.8728, recall of 0.8580, and F1 score of 0.8643, PathogenicityPredictor provides a fast, accurate, and scalable method for classifying genetic mutations. These capabilities make it an invaluable tool for making precise diagnoses of clinical significance, which ultimately contributes to better treatment plans for individual patients.
